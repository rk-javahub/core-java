 *         What is prime number? A prime number is a natural number greater than
 *         1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 * 
 * 
 *         I have seen at many places iteration starting from i=2 to i<=n/2
 *         which offers time complexity of O(n/2). But, we will start iterating
 *         from i=2 to i<=Math.sqrt(n). Q. why i<=Math.sqrt(n)? A.It will help
 *         us in reducing time complexity from O(n/2) to O(âˆš N).
